# Adobe Analytics Mobile App

Beta documentation for Analytics Mobile App

## Introduction

The Adobe Analytics Mobile App provides meaningful data visualizations on mobile devices for quick access and analysis. Curated visualizations are tailored as a dashboard of scorecards in a tiled layout that can be tapped for more detailed tables and trend reports. The mobile app is supported on both ios and Android operating systems.
